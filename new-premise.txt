-- style: --
doesnt matter. make it so lazy that it becomes its own style

-- character: --
WASD to move
space to jump
shift to dash
R to reset

3 HP.
gears dont use custom made systems, use like the roblox API.
gears only have 1 move. no in depth movesets, 1 move. this is cuz ur gonna be combining a lot of them, so like
keep most of them individually simple but the actual gameplay diverse!

summary > youre a new intern hired by the *Brickbattle Association* to become Gorpo's sucessor.
unfortunately you end up being a victim of Gorpo's last failed experiment,
your job is to escape whatever void you got sucked into.

*whos gorpo?*
some evil dark knight scientist idk guy but he made the ""subspace"" so the world is all his and hes like the ultimate
boss force

*whats the brickbattle association?*
idk

*whats the subspace?*
IDK infinite void that stems from the creator's (as in guy who MADE the subspace tripmine) like imagination.
basically ur stuck in gorpos little dream world or something. and as ssoon as you kill him, youll be free
