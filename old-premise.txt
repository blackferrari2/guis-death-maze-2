-- story (presented in like paper mario way): --
lhorme, king of subspace, was too, one of us - the peaceful citizens of dance town.

Then came the day where he became the first to come into contact with the all-mighty subpace tripmine.

ever since, he has obtained unfathomable amounts of power.

Obsessed with his newfound control, he so chose to travel all sorts of dimentions in search of purpose,
i mean, i dont think anything is gonna be that exciting when you can just destroy the world in a matter
of seconds.

What he doesnt know, is that he still owes me R$100. He used it to buy that weird silly knight hat of his.
And im running out of money myself, so im just asking you to bring us some justice and get our money back
at least. No need to kill the almighty subspace lord, just make him summon a giant pile of gold for us or whatever.

Haha, thats all we have to offer. We at dance town wish you the best!

Surprisignly, lhorme left a few portals to the worlds hes been travelling to, no idea why. Just enter
one of those weird structures with dark entrances on them!
